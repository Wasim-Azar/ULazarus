# UniversityCourseManager

UniversityCourseManager â€“ ASP.NET Core Web Application
MVC | Entity Framework Core | SQL Server | 
Role-Based Authorization Developed a full-featured university management web application as a personal project to strengthen my full-stack development skills. Key contributions:

Independently designed and implemented the relational database in SQL Server, including tables, relationships, and constraints.

Used Entity Framework Core for efficient and scalable data access.

Built a responsive user interface using ASP.NET Core MVC.

Implemented role-based authorization to manage secure access for students, faculty, and administrators.

Focused on clean architecture, maintainability, and real-world usability.

PS about roles:
Admin role: Email: wasim@ulazarus.be  Password: Admin.Wasim@1 ----   Teacher role: Email: alice.jansen@ulazarus.be   Password: Teacher@Pass1

PS: Please execute the Database Script first to be able to launch the project.
Make sure you have the correct connection string:
"DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ULazarus;Trusted_Connection=True;"
